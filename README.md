# Teeth Recognition
Repository to collect the code used to implement an image feature comparison.

## Introduction and motivations

The main goal is to apply such algorithm, firstly implemented to compare generic images features, to recognise teeth characteristics. This would have several importa applications of high importance, e.g. the identification of people from the dental features. 

### Shape recognition in images

### Mass disaster and other applications

## Scale-Invariant Feature Transform

### The optimised version: Speeded Up Robust Feature

## Easy task: Compare two coins

## A not-so-easy task: Compare two radiographs

## Conclusions and future developments
