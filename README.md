# Teeth Recognition

Repository to collect the code used to implement an image feature comparison.

## Introduction and motivations

The main goal is to apply such algorithm, firstly implemented to compare generic images features, to recognise teeth characteristics. This would have several important applications of high importance, e.g. the identification of people from the dental features. 

The main idea is to create a library collecting methods from `openCV`, to make comparison between images to identify subjects up to a certain level of confidence.

A motivational example might be the following: imagine the case of a [mass disaster](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/mass-disaster). 
In such an event it is crucial the precise and rapid identification of victims, a [process](http://www.weareforensic.co.uk/mass-disasters-disaster-victim-identification/) that can be quite complicate.
An image comparison system might help the forensic odontologist to compare hundreds of radiographs and find the one with highest similarity score with the given one.

### Shape recognition in images

### Mass disaster and other applications

## Scale-Invariant Feature Transform

### The optimised version: Speeded Up Robust Feature

## Getting dirty: examples

### Easy task: Compare two coins

### A not-so-easy task: Compare two radiographs

## Metric: a score to quantify how similar are two images
