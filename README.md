# teeth-recognition
Repository to collect the code used to implement an image feature comparison.

## Introduction

The main goal is to apply such algorithm, firstly implemented to compare generic images features, to recognise teeth characteristics. This would have several importa applications of high importance, e.g. the identification of people from the dental features.
