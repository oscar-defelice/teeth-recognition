class Image:
    """
        Class for image loading and processing.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        color:  boolean, optional, default=True
                It specifies to load a color image.
                Any transparency of image will be neglected.
                It is the default flag.
                Alternatively, we can pass integer value 1 for this flag.
        
        grayscale:  boolean, optional, default=False
                    It specifies to load an image in grayscale mode.
                    Alternatively, we can pass integer value 0 for this flag.
            
        unchanged:  boolean, optional, default=False
                    It specifies to load an image as such including alpha channel.
                    Alternatively, we can pass integer value -1 for this flag.
        
        Attributes
        ----------
        size_ : tuple (n_pixels_row, n_pixels_columns, n_channels)
                Image dimension in pixels.
        
        path_ : str
                Path location of the file.

        img_  : obj
                Image object.

        From the implementation point of view, this is just a collection of methods to import and preprocess an image, by using several openCV method.
